VTS Board is an ongoing project that I started one weekend while I was in a coding bootcamp. My goal is to create an application that provides tools for photo and art teachers to conduct Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) exercises. 

This current version allows users to upload an image with basic whiteboad and chat features to faciliate conversation. I will continue working on this during the summer of 2022.
